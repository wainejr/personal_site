# Personal site

This is my personal site, it is hosted at http://www.wainejr.com.

It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the theme [Hugo-Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) by [Luiz de Pr√°](https://github.com/luizdepra).
For more informations about serving locally this site, check the docs from Hugo and Hugo-Coder. (run `hugo serve`)
